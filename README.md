The Jacobi method, the Gauss-Seidel, and the SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iterative methods are used to solve AX = B using the matrix market format for input and output of data. For the Jacobi, 
Gauss-Seidel, and SOR methods, the input data is in the files A.dat and B.dat; the output files are in C.dat .
