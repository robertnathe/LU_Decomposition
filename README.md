The Jacobi iteration algorithm, Gauss-Seidel iteration algorithm, the SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iteration algorithm, and the direct tridiagonal Thomas algorithm are implemented. The input data files are A.dat and B.dat. The output file is X_out.dat . The Matrix_Operations_Library contains a collection of utility functions for matrix and vector operations, along with a main function that demonstrates their usage. The Matrix_Operations_Libary uses std::vector to implement 2D matrices and 1D vectors and is designed to work with the Matrix Market file format for input and output of matrices and vectors. The stochastic gradient descent algorithm updates the weights of a neural network based on the error between predicted and target outputs with specific rules for the input layer and hidden layer weights. A neural network's architecture and training process include activation functions that introduce non-linearity and forward propagation functions that pass the input through the hidden and output layers.
