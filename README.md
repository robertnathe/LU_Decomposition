The Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iteration methods, and a direct method for tridiagonal matrices, the Thomas algorithm, are used to solve AX = B. The input data  files are A.dat and B.dat; the output data is in the file C.dat .

Compile the TridiagonalSolve file using g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp.
