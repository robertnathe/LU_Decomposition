The Jacobi iteration method, Gauss-Seidel iteration method, SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iteration method algorithms, as well as the direct tridiagonal Thomas algorithm, which is a direct algorithm, are implemented. The input data files are A_out.dat and B_out.dat. The output file is X_out.dat . Testing_Function implements a small matrix library that is based upon the STL vector class; it also implements a makefile. The stochastic gradient descent algorithm updates the weights of a neural network based on the error between predicted and target outputs with specific rules for the input layer and hidden layer weights. A neural network's architecture and training process include activation functions that introduce non-linearity and forward propagation functions that pass the input through the hidden and output layers.
