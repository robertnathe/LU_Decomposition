The Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iteration methods, and a direct method for tridiagonal matrices, the Thomas algorithm, solve AX = B. The input data  files are A.dat and B.dat; the output data is in the file X.dat .

Testing_Function implements a small matrix library based upon the STL vector class using a makefile.
