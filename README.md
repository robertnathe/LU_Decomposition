The LU decomposition method is used to solve AX = B with and without pivoting. The Jacobi iterative method, the Gauss-Seidel method, and the SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) method are used to solve AX = B using the matrix market format for input and output of data. For the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR methods, the input data is in the files A.dat and B.dat; the output files are in C.dat .
