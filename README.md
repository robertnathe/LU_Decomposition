The Jacobi iteration method, Gauss-Seidel iteration method, SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iteration method algorithms, as well as the direct tridiagonal Thomas algorithm, which is a direct algorithm, are implemented. The input data files are A.dat and B.dat. The output file is X.dat . Testing_Function implements a small matrix library that is based upon the STL vector class; it also implements a makefile.
