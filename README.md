The Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iterative algorithms, and the tridiagonal Thomas algorithms, which is a direct algorithm, are implemented. The input data files are A.dat and B.dat. The output data file is X.dat . Testing_Function implements a small matrix library based upon the STL vector class using a makefile.
