The Jacobi iteration method, Gauss-Seidel iteration method, SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iteration method algorithms, as well as the direct tridiagonal Thomas algorithm, which is a direct algorithm, are implemented. The input data files are A.dat and B.dat. The output file is X.dat . Testing_Function implements a small matrix library that is based upon the STL vector class; it also implements a makefile. The core components of a neural network's architecture and training process include activation functions that introduce non-linearity, forward propagation that passes the input through the hidden and output layers, and stochastic gradient descent algorithm that updates the weights based on the error between predicted and target outputs with specific update rules for the input layer and hidden layer weights.
