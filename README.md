The Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR (Successive Overrelaxation) iterative methods, and a direct method for tridiagonal matrices, the Thomas algorirthm, are used to solve AX = B. The input data  files are A.dat and B.dat; the output file is C.dat . 

Compile the IterativeSolve file using g++ -std=c++20 IterativeSolve.cpp or 
compile the TDMA file using g++ -std=c++20 TDMA.cpp
